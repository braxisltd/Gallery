My name is Darren Ballinger. While I don't feel as though I am an artist, I enjoy making photographs. I say that I am not an artist as I do not try to see meaning in other people's photographs and I do not try to convey any in mine. I love images purely for the image's sake.
I feel that anything goes with photography. If a photo comes out of the camera exactly as I want to publish it then fine. However I rarely find that nature works in harmony with both my imagination and camera sensor so I have absolutely no qualms remedying this in post-production. You may notice this!

I earn my keep as a software consultant and I created this image gallery as a little project to keep my mind sharp, and of course to showcase some of my favourite images! I have made it available as open-source under my company - Braxis Ltd. More details can be found at <a href="http://www.braxis-ltd.com">www.braxis-ltd.com</a>.
